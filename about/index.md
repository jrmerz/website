# Me

## Background

I graduated from [UC Davis](http://ucdavis.edu/) with a degree in Computer Science
and Engineering and have worked at basically UC Davis ever since.  I took a break
to work at [Stone Cobra](http://www.stonecobra.com/) as well.  You can find most of my day to day work on
 [GitHub](https://github.com/jrmerz) as almost every project I work on, both
 professionally and privately are managed there.

# This site

This site was generated using a [custom site generator](https://github.com/jrmerz/markdown-site-generator)
from markdown files and is managed through github.  Repo [here](https://github.com/jrmerz/website).

Basically the site generator is an aggregate of:

- [Marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked): markdown parser
- [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) : templating
- [Bootstr.386](https://github.com/kristopolous/BOOTSTRA.386) : theme
- A splash of my own 2 cents
