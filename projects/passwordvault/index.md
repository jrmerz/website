# Password Vault

[Password Vault](https://github.com/jrmerz/nw-password-vault) is a simple
[node-webkit](http://nwjs.io/) application.  I wanted to toy with
node webkit as it allows for the use of my usual webapp development stack for
native OS applications.  The short is you get a UI layer (webkit) on top of NodeJS.

Password vault still leverages utilities such as bower to pull in libraries,
jQuery, Bootstrap, etc.

The app encrypts JSON files and provides UI for unlocking, searching and editing
or records (most likely website passwords and the like).  You can have more
than one vault, encrypting each with a different password.

## Dev Stack
- [node-webkit](http://nwjs.io/)
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Bootswatch/Paper](https://bootswatch.com/paper/)
