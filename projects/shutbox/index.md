# Shut Box

A simple game I used to play as a kid.  Two dice, try and roll numbers 1-9, keep
rolling as long as you roll and number you haven't yet.  Low score wins.

Mostly built for playing around with [websockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) for a simple
realtime game.  Something like [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) would
be a much better fit in reality.  Instead I used [Socket.IO](http://socket.io/) so
I could build from scratch.
