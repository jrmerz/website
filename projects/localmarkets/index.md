# Local Markets

Local Markets [local-markets.justinmerz.net](https://local-markets.justinmerz.net) is 'progressive webapp'
designed around helping you find local farmers markets.  The app is designed around
the idea that markets happen once our twice a week, but you may need food sooner than
that.  So the app displays results ordered by the next time the market opens for
all markets in a certain distance for your current location.
