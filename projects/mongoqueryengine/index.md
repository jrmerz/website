# mongo-query-engine

A lightweight layer for [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/) that provides a restful
search interface to a collection in [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/).  Powered
by a simple config file, the rest API provides an interface were mongo queries
can be passed and results with filter information is passed back.  Supports
standard query mechanisms like pagination.

You can find out more information in the README of the [repo](https://github.com/CSTARS/mongo-query-engine).
