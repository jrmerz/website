# Markdown Site Generator

This site was generated using [markdown-site-generator](https://github.com/jrmerz/markdown-site-generator).
The website files are [here](https://github.com/jrmerz/website).

Basically the site generator is an aggregate of:

- [Marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked): markdown parser
- [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) : templating
- [Bootstr.386](https://github.com/kristopolous/BOOTSTRA.386) : theme
- A splash of my own 2 cents

Cause sometimes we all need to reinvent a square wheel.
